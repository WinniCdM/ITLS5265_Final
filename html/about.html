                    <p>Hello, my name is Benjamin Winslett. I am currently a student at Utah State University, studying Computer Science. I live in Northern Utah. In my free time I enjoy lots of things, from going on adventures with my wife, Lindsi, to drawing, painting, and creating. I enjoy being an artist as a hobby and always look forward to the chances I get to become better. I hope you enjoy the art I've created as much as I've enjoyed painting them.</p>
